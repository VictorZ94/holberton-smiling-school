### Overview

This design is to practice all what I have learned in HTML CSS.
Building a web page the right way, is not easy. 

In this oportunity, I'm going to craft a whole web page from scratch with bootstrap using the best practice for it.

### Tech tools used

- reset CSS styling
- use variables
- simple/“as generic as you can” CSS selectors
- avoid as more as you can super specific CSS selector
- simple HTML structure - div containers are my best friend!
- flexbox
- Bootstrap 

### Framework

Bootstrap is a free and open-source CSS framework directed at responsive, mobile-first front-end web development. It contains CSS- and (optionally) JavaScript-based design templates for typography, forms, buttons, navigation, and other interface components.
